# Multi-Theme Switcher App (Next.js App Router)

## Overview

This is a Next.js application built with the App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v3, and Context API. It allows users to switch between three distinct themes (Minimalist, Dark Mode, Colorful) with unique layouts, fonts, colors, and spacing. The app fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com), persists themes using `localStorage`, and includes subtle GSAP animations for page transitions and component rendering. The architecture is optimized for **performance**, **scalability**, **security**, and **responsiveness**, making it suitable for large-scale applications like Amazon.

## Features

- **Theme Switching**: Three themes (Minimalist, Dark with sidebar, Colorful with cards), persisted via `localStorage` with debounced updates for performance.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layouts using Tailwind CSS utilities with responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) and theme-specific tokens.
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router for Home, About, and Contact pages.
- **Data Fetching**: Server-side fetching from Fake Store API with static caching (`force-cache`).
- **Animations**: GSAP for smooth, performant page transitions and product card animations with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
- **Security**: Sanitized inputs, secure API calls (HTTPS), and meta tags to prevent indexing of sensitive data.
- **Performance**: Server Components, lazy-loaded images (`loading="lazy"`), code splitting, and `Suspense` for dynamic page loading.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-current`, `role`) and keyboard navigation support.
- **Scalability**: Modular components, theme token system in `tailwind.config.js`, and TypeScript for type safety.
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup of GSAP animations and debounced functions to prevent leaks.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1. **Create a new Next.js project**:

Components

Header.tsx: Client component with responsive navigation and theme switcher dropdown.
ProductList.tsx: Client component displaying products in a theme-specific layout (grid for Theme 1/3, column for Theme 2).

Context

ThemeContext.ts: Manages theme state with localStorage persistence, using debounced updates for performance.

Routes

layout.tsx: Root layout with ThemeProvider and GSAP animations.
page.tsx: Home page with server-side data fetching.
about/page.tsx, contact/page.tsx: Static pages with GSAP animations.

Styles

globals.css: Minimal CSS for theme-specific variables, with Tailwind utilities for all styling.
tailwind.config.js: Custom theme tokens for colors, fonts, spacing, and border-radius, ensuring scalability.

Data Structures

Theme Configuration: Uses CSS variables (hash map) for O(1) access to theme properties.
Product Data: Array of objects { id: number, title: string, price: number, image: string, description: string } from Fake Store API.

Theme Details

Theme 1 (Minimalist):

Colors: Light background (#f9fafb), dark text (#1f2937), blue primary (#3b82f6).
Font: Open Sans (sans-serif).
Layout: Standard grid (1–3 columns based on screen size).
Spacing: 1rem base unit.


Theme 2 (Dark Mode):

Colors: Dark background (#1f2937), light text (#f9fafb), deep blue primary (#1d4ed8).
Font: Lora (serif).
Layout: Sidebar-style column layout on medium+ screens.
Spacing: 1.5rem base unit.


Theme 3 (Colorful):

Colors: Warm background (#fef3c7), brown text (#7c2d12), orange primary (#ea580c).
Font: Pacifico (cursive).
Layout: Card-based grid (1–3 columns).
Spacing: 2rem base unit.



Usage

Select a theme from the header dropdown (persists across reloads).
Navigate to Home, About, or Contact via header links.
View products on the Home page, adapting to the selected theme’s layout, fonts, and colors.

Troubleshooting
Tailwind CSS Error (e.g., px-4 not working)
Cause: Version mismatch or misconfigured tailwind.config.js.
Fix:
yarn remove tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
yarn add --dev tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
yarn tailwindcss init -p


Ensure tailwind.config.js includes:content: ['./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],


Verify src/styles/globals.css imports Tailwind directives:@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;



Webpack Cache Error (ENOENT)
Fix:
cd multi-theme-switcher
rm -rf .next
yarn cache clean
yarn install
yarn dev


Run as administrator if permission issues occur.
Check folder permissions: Properties > Security > Full control.

GSAP Animation Issues
Cause: Improper cleanup or missing dependencies.
Fix:

Ensure gsap is installed: yarn add gsap.
Verify cleanup in useEffect hooks (e.g., gsap.killTweensOf).

General

Verify Node.js and Yarn versions:node -v  # Should be v24.3.0
yarn --version


Update Yarn if needed:npm install -g yarn



Future Improvements

Testing: Add unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
Performance: Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic product updates.
Lazy Loading: Extend lazy loading to product images beyond loading="lazy".
Animations: Enhance GSAP animations for interactive elements (e.g., hover effects).
Accessibility: Add more ARIA roles and WCAG compliance checks.
Scalability: Introduce a state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit) for complex state in larger apps.

Development Notes

### Notes

- The `README.md` assumes the optimized files from the previous response (using GSAP, Tailwind CSS, etc.) are in place. If you need me to regenerate or tweak any of those files, please let me know.
- The file structure matches the provided overview, with minimal `globals.css` for theme variables and Tailwind directives.
- Troubleshooting sections cover the errors you mentioned (Tailwind `px-4`, Webpack ENOENT).
- The app is optimized for large-scale use, with considerations for performance (e.g., `force-cache`, `Suspense`), scalability (modular components, theme tokens), and security (sanitized inputs, HTTPS).

Let me know if you need further adjustments to the `README.md` or any other files!
